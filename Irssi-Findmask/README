You can use this script with irssi to find any nick with a specific hostmask. It's for comedic purposes and I wrote it specifically for one regular of a channel I visit who always has a different nickname, so it announces to the channel. The hostmask match can be modified on line 27. In version 3 I added a user match as well. Might add a realname match in future versions, really depends on the antics of six himself.
